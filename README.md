# Exercise-8-Python
In this second exercise you will have to create a script that tells us if it is time to go home. You will have to use the time module. You will need the system date and be able to check the time.  If it is after 7 o'clock, a message will be displayed and otherwise, you will carry out an operation to calculate the time remaining for work.
